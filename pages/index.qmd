This dashboard is designed for the [Flu Metrocast hub](https://github.com/reichlab/flu-metrocast/tree/main), a national platform enabling collaborative, city-level forecasting of influenza-related emergency department visits and hospital admissions.

Currently, the project focuses on two regions: 

- New York city
  - Target: ILI (Influenza-like Illness) ED visit counts
  - Data source : [New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene](https://a816-health.nyc.gov/hdi/epiquery/visualizations?PageType=ps&PopulationSource=Syndromic)
  - Target areas: Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Queens, NYC (citywide)

- Texas Metro Areas
  - Target: Percentage of ED visits due to flu
  - Data Source : CDC's [Emergency Department Visits for Viral Respiratory Illness](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/activity-levels.html)
  - Target areas: These metro areas include both the named city and surrounding counties:
    - Austin: Bastrop, Burnet, Lee, Llano, Travis, Williamson
    - Houston: Austin, Chambers, Fort Bend, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, San Jacinto, Waller
    - Dallas: Collin, Dallas, Ellis, Hopkins, Hunt, Kaufman, Rains, Rockwall
    - El Paso: Culberson, El Paso, Hudspeth, Loving
    - San Antonio: Atascosa, Bandera, Bexar, Frio, Gonzales, Guadalupe, Kendall, La Salle, McMullen, Medina, Wilson, Zavala
    
### Models Included
- epiENGAGE-GBQR : A machine learning method that combines gradient boosting and quantile regression to predict conditional quantiles
- epiENGAGE-INFLAenza : A spatial time-series model that uses the R-INLA package for estimating forecast posterior distributions.
- epiENGAGE-Copycat :  A pattern matching model that matches growth rate trends to historic growth rate curves.
- Epiforecasts-dyngam : A Bayesian hierarchical GAM with a univariate AR(1) process
- epiENGAGE-baseline : simple time series model as a reference model
- epiENGAGE-ensemble_mean : An equally weighted mean ensemble that takes the mean at each quantile level of all eligible forecasts
- epiENGAGE-log_norm : Linear pool (a.k.a. distributional mixture) ensemble of quantile forecast submissions.
