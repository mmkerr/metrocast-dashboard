This dashboard is designed for the [Flu Metrocast hub](https://github.com/reichlab/flu-metrocast/tree/main).

The target data for the Flu Metrocast includes ILI ED visits and Flu ED visits percentages. Both datasets are publicly available through [New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene](https://a816-health.nyc.gov/hdi/epiquery/visualizations?PageType=ps&PopulationSource=Syndromic) or CDC's [Emergency Department Visits for Viral Respiratory Illness](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/activity-levels.html).
