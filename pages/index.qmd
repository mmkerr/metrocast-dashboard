This dashboard is part of the [epiENGAGE](https://epiengage.org) project, a CDC-funded collaboration involving over 20 research labs and public health departments dedicated to developing science-based tools and training programs that help local agencies detect, forecast, and respond to outbreaks more effectively. 

This particular dashboard is designed for the [Flu Metrocast hub](https://github.com/reichlab/flu-metrocast/tree/main), a national platform enabling collaborative, city-level forecasting of influenza-related emergency department visits and hospital admissions.

##  Models Included

- epiENGAGE-GBQR : A machine learning method that combines gradient boosting and quantile regression to predict conditional quantiles
- epiENGAGE-INFLAenza : A spatial time-series model that uses the R-INLA package for estimating forecast posterior distributions.
- epiENGAGE-Copycat :  A pattern matching model that matches growth rate trends to historic growth rate curves.
- Epiforecasts-dyngam : A Bayesian hierarchical GAM with a univariate AR(1) process
- epiENGAGE-baseline : simple time series model as a reference model
- epiENGAGE-ensemble_mean : An equally weighted mean ensemble that takes the mean at each quantile level of all eligible forecasts
- epiENGAGE-log_norm : Linear pool (a.k.a. distributional mixture) ensemble of quantile forecast submissions.
